 85195362067,2-s2.0-85195362067,"Artificial intelligence technology has opened up new horizons for higher education, but it has also increased the scale and complexity of higher education data, posing numerous challenges for data governance. Firstly, the issue of data dependency not only affects the data itself but also has a reciprocal effect on technological development. Secondly, information silos hinder effective data sharing and integration between different departments or institutions. Additionally, security issues of privacy require finding a balance in open data sharing. Based on three major issues, this article aims to provide a reasonable evaluation and improvement scheme for educational data governance in the era of AI. Based at the principles of safety, effectiveness, and openness, a Dynamic Evaluation Model for Higher Education Data Governance in the era of AI is established, relying on seven evaluation indicators and three stages of dynamic changes. This model will analyze the current situation of higher education in China and propose optimization recommendations.",Optimization Study of Higher Education Data Governance in the Era of AI,Chen J.,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,,,2023-12-22,10.1145/3660043.3660169,,2,Conference Proceeding,cp,Conference Paper,,21101226881,0,False,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '@ref': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85195362067'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@ref': 'author-affiliation', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85195362067?field=author,affiliation'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@ref': 'scopus', '@href': 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85195362067&origin=inward'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@ref': 'scopus-citedby', '@href': 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85195362067&origin=inward'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', 'affilname': 'Shanghai University of International Business and Economics', 'affiliation-city': 'Shanghai', 'affiliation-country': 'China'}]",,,

Nevertheless, despite the growing body of technical knowledge and progress, the governance of AI-intensive technologies remains dynamic and challenging. A mounting chorus of experts have been sharing their reservations regarding an overemphasis on regulation in Europe. Among their core arguments is the concern that such an approach might hinder innovation within the AI arena. This concern resonates particularly strongly compared to the United States and Asia, where AI-driven innovation appears to be surging ahead, potentially leaving Europe behind. The current contribution is a position paper emphasising the need for balanced AI governance to foster ethical innovation, reliability, and competitiveness of European technology. This paper only explores recent AI regulations and upcoming European laws relevant to the topic to ensure conciseness while underscoring Europe’s role in the global AI landscape. The authors analyse European governance approaches and their impact, especially on SMEs and startups, offering a comparative view of global regulatory efforts. We address the complexities of creating a comprehensive, human-centred AI master’s programme for higher education and the importance of ethical AI education.

These adverse effects are also seen as ethical issues and affect trustworthiness in medical AI and need to be managed through identification, prognosis and monitoring. Methods;We adopted a multidisciplinary approach and summarized five subjects that influence the trustworthiness of medical AI: data quality, algorithmic bias, opacity, safety and security, and responsibility attribution, and discussed these factors from the perspectives of technology, law, and healthcare stakeholders and institutions. The ethical framework of ethical values-ethical principles-ethical norms is used to propose corresponding ethical governance countermeasures for trustworthy medical AI from the ethical, legal, and regulatory aspects. Results; Medical data are primarily unstructured, lacking uniform and standardized annotation, and data quality will directly affect the quality of medical AI algorithm models. Algorithmic bias can affect AI clinical predictions and exacerbate health disparities. The opacity of algorithms affects patients’ and doctors’ trust in medical AI, and algorithmic errors or security vulnerabilities can pose significant risks and harm to patients. The involvement of medical AI in clinical practices may threaten doctors ‘and patients’ autonomy and dignity. When accidents occur with medical AI, the responsibility attribution is not clear. All these factors affect people’s trust in medical AI. Conclusions; In order to make medical AI trustworthy, at the ethical level, the ethical value orientation of promoting human health should first and foremost be considered as the top-level design. At the legal level, current medical AI does not have moral status and humans remain the duty bearers.

The estimated incidence of vision loss at 5 years was 1535 per 100,000 in the AI-screened group compared to 1625 per 100,000 in the ECP group, leading to a modelled risk difference of 90 per 100,000. The base-case CAREVL model estimated that an autonomous AI-based screening strategy would result in 27,000 fewer Americans with vision loss at 5 years compared with ECP. Vision loss at 5 years remained lower in the AI-screened group compared to the ECP group, in a wide range of parameters including optimistic estimates biased toward ECP.

85183987574,2-s2.0-85183987574,"The paper focuses on the category of “artificial intelligence” as an object of civil law regulation. In an age of rapid technological change, digital technologies (DT) have firmly entered various areas of socio-economic relations. The development of DT in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) required the creation of legal regulations for their use. Simultaneously, an important area of legal transformation is civil legislation, which mediates a wide range of property-value and personal non-property relations. To achieve the goals outlined in the work, the authors applied a dialectical approach and formal-logical, comparative-legal, systemic, and structural–functional research methods. Due to the development of high technologies and the creation of AI, there is a need for amendments to the legislation, for example, on the recognition of copyright for intellectual property objects created by artificial intelligence. The norms of the current civil legislation in the field of intellectual property do not make it possible to determine the legal regime of such objects. That is why the current socio-economic realities require the transformation of the norms of civil law regulation in the field of intellectual property. The authors also note that it is necessary to regulate civil law norms of relations to ensure workflow using AI technologies and establish the procedure for concluding contracts in electronic form, particularly smart contracts.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a novel approach that makes collecting and analyzing data in complex systems more accessible. This study highlights recent research on AI's application and capabilities in health policymaking.; Methods: We searched PubMed, Scopus, and the Web of Science databases to find relevant studies from 2000 to 2023, using the keywords ""artificial intelligence"" and ""policymaking."" We used Walt and Gilson's policy triangle framework for charting the data.; Results: The results revealed that using AI in health policy paved the way for novel analyses and innovative solutions for intelligent decision-making and data collection, potentially enhancing policymaking capacities, particularly in the evaluation phase. It can also be employed to create innovative agendas with fewer political constraints and greater rationality, resulting in evidence-based policies. By creating new platforms and toolkits, AI also offers the chance to make judgments based on solid facts. The majority of the proposed AI solutions for health policy aim to improve decision-making rather than replace experts.;Conclusion: Numerous approaches exist for AI to influence the health policymaking process.

Several challenges are also named: ethics, human rights, cybersecurity, access to reliable data, transparency, and the digital gap. The solutions presented are multi-stakeholder collaboration, cohesive but flexible governance frameworks, but also taking the lead to push for ethical and value-based AI and making sure AI is sustainable. Ideas about AI appear to stem from discourses of ecological modernisation and green governmentality. This framing turns political and structural challenges into technical issues to be solved with more data, greater collaboration, and technical progress.
